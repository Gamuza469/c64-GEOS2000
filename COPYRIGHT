I don't know really what is the state of these sources. I may say
that they belong to me because they are modified and reassigned.
On the other hand they come from disassembling GEOS KERNAL code.
However you will do nothing without orignal GEOS system because
you can't do anything with kernal without DeskTop.

Anyway, from my point of view they are free to use as long as I
and Berkeley Softworks will be credited.

Fell free, ACME is a GNU tool too.
